<br>

###  expressions<br>

nesting:The <body> container tag needs to surround all the elements displayed on the page. When some HTML tags go inside others<br>

head :You can use the head to help increase visibility and traffic from search engines like Google.<br>

Title, description and keywords are nested in the head tag.<br>

Indentation :a very good practice to improve code readability. Indentation is the spaces at the beginning of lines.<br>

web browser : Displays the web page<br>

web server : Stores and provides information<br>

formatting tags : Formatting tags are applied to text and are nested inside elements.<br>



b: bold <br>

u : underline text<br>

i : italic <br>

strong : highlight important text, it also has meaning and is used by screen readers<br>

em : define emphasized text, screen reader will verbally stress the words.<br>


Web accessibility : making websites more inclusive and removing barriers<br>

Screen readers : programs that make the content of a web site accessible to users who are blind, visually impaired or have a learning disability.<br>

semantic formatting tags : The strong and em tags are considered semantic formatting tags because they add meaning to the content. They can serve as an indication of emphasis to a screen reader.<br>


HyperText : a text that contains a link to another page, Web pages are called HyperText documents because they are connected by hyberlinks <br>

href: stands for HyperText reference.<br>


Landing page : In digital marketing, a landing page is where a visitor “lands” after clicking on a link in an email, an ad on Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

Landing pages are great for selling stuff; they also let you track customers and collect data.

Whether you're looking to be a web developer, marketer, or even a data scientist, landing pages can be invaluable.<br> 

Attributes : You can have more control over HTML elements with attributes.
Attributes are modifiers that provide additional information about elements.Attributes can be optional or required. e.g img tag requred src att.For container tags, the attributes always go in the opening tag. The anchor tag is another example of an HTML element that requires an attribute to work correctly.( a tag requred href att . )href (in the anchor tag) and src (in the image tag) are examples of attributes.
<br>

some attributes: <br>

alt : (alternative text) is used to add image descriptions.1.read aloud by screen readers
.2.shown when the image doesn’t load
.3.read by search engines
<br>

Width: is an optional attribute.You can control the size of images in your web pages.controls the horizontal dimension of an image.
name = "value" e.g width ia an att name and "300" is value of an att.
<br>

Height :  is an optional attribute for the image element.Both width and height are measured in pixels by default.

When only one of the 2 attributes is given, the web browser will calculate the other based on the aspect ratio so the image is not stretched or squeezed.The aspect ratio of an image determines its rectangular shape.
Changing the aspect ratio of an image causes distortion, which can look bad.<br>

The way visitors navigate a website depends on its design. Websites come in 2 shapes:

 

- Multiple-page websites

- Single-page websites.
